# METHODS (Minimal)

This repo implements **proxy** signals for the NO criterion:
- **MDL-Δ (proxy)**: difference in compressed length (zlib) between pre- and post- corpora.
- **Network rupture (proxy)**: change in simple graph statistics (largest component size; average clustering).

**Poietic Index L***:
L* = 0.30·NO + 0.25·¬RC + 0.20·NN + 0.15·IF + 0.10·Ctrl

See the paper for definitions and the full rubric.
